# smart_bin_system_design
 This project introduces a smart waste sorting bin tailored for primary schools, harnessing computer vision and the YOLOv8 framework to detect and classify waste items placed in a sorting box. The system sorts waste into four school-appropriate recycling categories (4 categories: Mixed Recycling, Food Waste, General Waste, and Paper) and uses motor-driven mechanisms, controlled by ESP32-S3 microcontrollers, to automatically direct items into the correct bins. Aimed at fostering recycling awareness among young students, the bin offers real-time object detection, a user-friendly GUI for monitoring, and educational components to engage children in sustainable practices. The repository provides a comprehensive implementation, encompassing YOLOv8 model training scripts, GUI development, machine learning integration, and firmware for ESP32-S3-based motor control and communication.
